RGBDS
=====

RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) is a free assembler/linker package
for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It consists of:

- rgbasm (assembler)
- rgblink (linker)
- rgbfix (checksum/header fixer)
- rgbgfx (PNG‐to‐Game Boy graphics converter)

This is a fork of the original RGBDS which aims to make the programs more like
other UNIX tools.

This toolchain is maintained on `GitHub <https://github.com/rednex/rgbds>`__.

The documentation of this toolchain can be viewed online
`here <https://rgbds.gbdev.io/docs/>`__, it is generated from the man pages
found in this repository.

If you want to contribute or maintain RGBDS, and have questions regarding the code, its organisation, etc. you can find me `on GBDev <https://gbdev.io/chat>`__ or via mail at ``rgbds at eldred dot fr``.

1. Installing RGBDS
-------------------

The `installation procedure <https://rgbds.gbdev.io/install>`__ is available
online for various platforms. `Building from source <https://rgbds.gbdev.io/install/source>`__
is possible using ``make`` or ``cmake``; follow the link for more detailed instructions.

.. code:: sh

    make
    sudo make install

.. code:: sh

    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    cmake --install build

2. RGBDS Folder Organization
----------------------------

The RGBDS source code file structure somewhat resembles the following:

.. _clang-format: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html

- ``.github/`` - files and scripts related to the integration of the RGBDS codebase with
  GitHub.

  * ``actions/`` - scripts used by workflow files.
  * ``workflows/`` - CI workflow description files.

- ``contrib/`` - scripts and other resources which may be useful to users and developers of
  RGBDS.

  * ``zsh_compl`` contains tab completion scripts for use with zsh. Put them somewhere in your ``fpath``, and they should auto-load.

  * ``bash_compl`` contains tab completion scripts for use with bash. Run them with ``source`` somewhere in your ``.bashrc``, and they should load every time you open a shell.

- ``include/`` - header files for each respective C files in `src`.

- ``src/`` - source code and manual pages for RGBDS.

  * Note that the code unique to each RGBDS tool is stored in its respective subdirectory
    (rgbasm -> ``src/asm/``, for example). ``src/extern/`` contains code imported from external sources.

- ``test/`` - testing framework used to verify that changes to the code don't break or modify the behavior of RGBDS.

- ``.clang-format`` - code style for automated formatting with |clang-format|_. The C code does not currently follow this style, but all C++ code should.

3. History
----------

- Around 1997, Carsten Sørensen (AKA SurfSmurf) writes ASMotor as a
  general-purpose assembler/linker system for DOS/Win32

- Around 1999, Justin Lloyd (AKA Otaku no Zoku) adapts ASMotor to read and
  produce GBZ80 assembly/machine code, and releases this version as RGBDS.

- 2009, Vegard Nossum adapts the code to be more UNIX-like and releases
  this version as rgbds-linux on
  `GitHub <https://github.com/vegard/rgbds-linux>`__.

- 2010, Anthony J. Bentley forks that repository. The fork becomes the reference
  implementation of rgbds.

- 2017, Bentley's repository is moved to a neutral name.

- 2018, codebase relicensed under the MIT license.

- 2020, repository is moved to the `gbdev <https://github.com/gbdev>`__ organisation. The `rgbds.gbdev.io <https://rgbds.gbdev.io>`__ website serving documentation and downloads is created.
