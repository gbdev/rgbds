<P>The full GB-Z80 instruction-set is implemented with a few modifications to the original Zilog syntax. This is due
to a Bison problem but in my opinion the syntax is better than the original one.<BR>

    [n16]/[$FF00+n8]
    [$FF00+C]/[C]</PRE>          
<P>The  assembler will intelligently decide between  <B>[n16]</B> and  <B>[$FF00+n8]</B> in the LD instruction.  Note however  that  if  you  use  any <A HREF="symbols.htm">constant symbols</A> in the expression they had better  be defined before the instruction or your symbol-table may become mangled. Also worth noting is that it will only ever select the short $FF00 mode when you use constant symbols. NOT if you use symbols defined in a <A HREF="section.htm">HRAM section</A>. As this defies the whole point of implementing the HRAM sectiontype I've added the LDIO mnemonic. It works like the LD instruction but it will ALWAYS generate the $FF00+ form and it will also automatically logically AND the expression with $FF if it is relocatable. Which is what you want. Trust me ;)<BR>
