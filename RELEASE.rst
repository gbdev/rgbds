Releasing
=========

This describes for the maintainers of RGBDS how to publish a new release on
GitHub.

1. Update, commit, and push `include/version.hpp <include/version.hpp>`__ with
   values for ``PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR``, ``PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR``,
   ``PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH``, and ``PACKAGE_VERSION_RC``, as well as
   `Dockerfile <Dockerfile>`__ with a value for ``ARG version``. Only define
   ``PACKAGE_VERSION_RC`` if you are publishing a release candidate! You can
   use ``git commit -m "Release <version>"`` and ``git push origin master``.

2. Create a Git tag formatted as ``v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>``, or
   ``v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>-rc<RC>`` for a release candidate. ``MAJOR``,
   ``MINOR``, ``PATCH``, and ``RC`` should match their values from
   `include/version.hpp <include/version.hpp>`__. You can use ``git tag <tag>``.

3. Push the tag to GitHub. You can use ``git push origin <tag>``.

   GitHub Actions will run the `create-release-artifacts.yaml
   <.github/workflows/create-release-artifacts.yaml>`__ workflow to detect the
   tag starting with "``v[0-9]``" and automatically do the following:

   1. Build 32-bit and 64-bit RGBDS binaries for Windows with ``cmake``.

   2. Package the binaries into zip files.

   3. Package the source code into a tar.gz file with ``make dist``.

   4. Create a draft GitHub release for the tag, attaching the three
      packaged files. It will be a prerelease if the tag contains "``-rc``".

      If an error occurred in the above steps, delete the tag and restart the
      procedure. You can use ``git push --delete origin <tag>`` and
      ``git tag --delete <tag>``.

4. GitHub Actions will run the `create-release-docs.yml
   <.github/workflows/create-release-docs.yml>`__ workflow to add the release
   documentation to `rgbds-www <https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds-www>`__.

   For a release candidate, which creates a prerelease, you will have to
   take these steps yourself.

   1. Clone `rgbds-www <https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds-www>`__. You can use
      ``git clone https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds-www.git``.

   2. Make sure that you have installed ``groff`` and ``mandoc``. You will
      need ``mandoc`` 1.14.5 or later to support ``-O toc``.

   3. Run ``.github/actions/get-pages.sh -r <path/to/rgbds-www> <tag>``. This
      will render the RGBDS documentation as HTML and PDF and copy it to
      ``rgbds-www``.

      If you do not have ``groff`` installed, you can change
      ``groff -Tpdf -mdoc -wall`` to ``mandoc -Tpdf -I os=Linux`` in
      `.github/actions/get-pages.sh <.github/actions/get-pages.sh>`__ and it
      will suffice.

   4. Commit and push the documentation. You can use ``git commit -m
      "Create RGBDS <tag> documentation"`` and ``git push origin master``
      (within the ``rgbds-www`` directory, not RGBDS).

5. Write a changelog in the GitHub draft release.

6. Click the "Publish release" button to publish it!

7. Update the `release` branch. You can use ``git push origin release``.
