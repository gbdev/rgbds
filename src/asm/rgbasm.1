.Sh NAME
.Nm rgbasm
.Nd Game Boy assembler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rgbasm
.Op Fl EhLVvw
.Op Fl b Ar chars
.Op Fl D Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl g Ar chars
.Op Fl i Ar path
.Op Fl M Ar dependfile
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Fl p Ar pad_value
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program creates an object file from an assembly source file.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar chars
Change the two characters used for binary constants.
The defaults are 01.
.It Fl D Ar name Ns Op = Ns Ar value
Add string symbol to the compiled source code. This is equivalent to
.Ar name
.Cm EQUS
.Qq Ar "value"
in code. If a value is not specified, a value of 1 is given.
.It Fl E
Export all labels, including unreferenced and local labels.
.It Fl g Ar chars
Change the four characters used for binary constants.
The defaults are 0123.
.It Fl h
By default,
.Nm
inserts a
.Sq nop
instruction immediately after any
.Sq halt
instruction.
The
.Fl h
option disables this behavior.
.It Fl i Ar path
Add an include path.
.It Fl L
Disable the optimization that turns loads of the form
.Sy LD [$FF00+n8],A
into the opcode
.Sy LDH [$FF00+n8],A
in order to have full control of the result in the final ROM.
.It Fl M Ar dependfile
Print
.Xr make 1
dependencies to
.Ar dependfile .
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Write an object file to the given filename.
.It Fl p Ar pad_value
When padding an image, pad with this value.
The default is 0x00.
.It Fl V
Print the version of the program and exit.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.It Fl w
Disable warning output.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Assembling a basic source file is simple:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ rgbasm -o bar.o foo.asm
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting object file is not yet a usable ROM image \(em it must first be
run through
.Xr rgblink 1
and
.Xr rgbfix 1 .
