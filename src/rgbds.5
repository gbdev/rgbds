.Pp
.Ar LONG
is a 32-bit integer stored in little-endian format.
.Ar BYTE
is an 8-bit integer.
.Ar STRING
is a 0-terminated string of
.Ar BYTE .

.Ed
.Ss RPN DATA
Expressions in the object file are stored as RPN.
This is an expression of the form
.Dq 2 5 + .
This will first push the value
.Do 2 Dc to the stack, then
.Dq 5 .
The
.Do + Dc operator pops two arguments from the stack, adds them, and then pushes the result on the stack, effectively replacing the two top arguments with their sum.
In the RGB format, RPN expressions are stored as
.Ar BYTE Ns s
with some bytes being special prefixes for integers and symbols.
