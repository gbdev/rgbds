.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the description of the object files used by
.Xr rgbasm 1
and
.Xr rgblink 1 .
.Em Please note that the specifications may change.
This toolchain is in development and new features may require adding more information to the current format, or modifying some fields, which would break compatibility with older versions.
.Pp
.Sh FILE STRUCTURE
The following types are used:
.Pp
.Ar LONG
is a 32‐bit integer stored in little‐endian format.
.Ar BYTE
is an 8‐bit integer.
.Ar STRING
is a 0‐terminated string of
.Ar BYTE .
.Pp
.Bd -literal

BYTE    ID[4]            ; "RGB9"
LONG    RevisionNumber   ; The format's revision number this file uses
LONG    NumberOfSymbols  ; The number of symbols used in this file
LONG    NumberOfSections ; The number of sections used in this file

; Symbols

REPT    NumberOfSymbols   ; Number of symbols defined in this object file.

        STRING  FileName  ; File where the symbol is defined.

        LONG    LineNum   ; Line number in the file where the symbol is defined.

        LONG    SectionID ; The section number (of this object file) in which
                          ; this symbol is defined. If it doesn't belong to any

.Ed
.Ss RPN DATA
Expressions in the object file are stored as RPN.
This is an expression of the form
.Dq 2 5 + .
This will first push the value
.Do 2 Dc to the stack, then
.Dq 5 .
The
.Do + Dc operator pops two arguments from the stack, adds them, and then pushes the result on the stack, effectively replacing the two top arguments with their sum.
In the RGB format, RPN expressions are stored as
.Ar BYTE Ns s
with some bytes being special prefixes for integers and symbols.
