#/usr/bin/env bash

# Known bugs:
# - Newlines in file/directory names break this script
#   This is because we rely on `compgen -A`, which is broken like this.
#   A fix would require implementing it ourselves, and no thanks!
# - `rgbasm --binary-digits=a` is treated the same as `rgbasm --binary-digits=` (for example)
#   This is not our fault, Bash passes both of these identically.
#   Maybe it could be worked around, but such a fix would likely be involved.
#   The user can work around it by typing `--binary-digits ''` instead, for example.
# - Directories are not completed as such in "coalesced" short-opt arguments. For example,
#   `rgbasm -M d<tab>` can autocomplete to `rgbasm -M dir/` (no space), but
#   `rgbasm -Md<tab>` would autocomplete to `rgbasm -Mdir ` (trailing space) instead.
#   This is because dircetory handling is performed by Readline, whom we can't tell about the short
#   opt kerfuffle. The user can work around by separating the argument, as shown above.
#   (Also, there might be more possible bugs if `-Mdir` is actually a directory. Ugh.)

# Something to note:
# `rgbasm --binary-digits=a` gets passed to us as ('rgbasm' '--binary-digits' '=' 'a')
# Thus, we don't need to do much to handle that form of argument passing: skip '=' after long opts.
